### 1. **Distinction Between Elemental and Compound Semiconductors (3 Marks)**

**Elemental Semiconductors:**
- **Definition:** These are semiconductors made of a single element from the periodic table.
- **Examples:**
  - **Silicon (Si)**: The most widely used semiconductor in electronics.
  - **Germanium (Ge):** Used in early transistors and diodes.
- **Properties:** 
  - Consist of atoms from the same group in the periodic table (e.g., Group IV).
  - Have a single type of bonding (covalent bonding).
  
**Compound Semiconductors:**
- **Definition:** These are semiconductors made by combining two or more elements, typically from different groups in the periodic table.
- **Examples:**
  - **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs):** Used in high-speed devices like laser diodes, LEDs.
  - **Indium Phosphide (InP):** Used in high-frequency and high-power electronics.
- **Properties:** 
  - Consist of atoms from different groups (e.g., Group III-V or II-VI compounds).
  - Can have more varied electrical properties, such as higher mobility and efficiency for optoelectronics.

**Applications:**
- **Elemental Semiconductors** are mainly used in traditional electronic devices like diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits.
- **Compound Semiconductors** are used in specialized devices such as LEDs, laser diodes, solar cells, and high-frequency applications (e.g., RF amplifiers).

### 2. **Energy Band Diagrams Under Equilibrium (3 Marks)**

**i) Intrinsic Semiconductor:**
- **Description:** In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of free electrons is equal to the number of holes. There is no external doping.
- **Energy Band Diagram:**
  - The **conduction band (CB)** and **valence band (VB)** are separated by the **energy gap (Eg)**.
  - The **Fermi level (Ef)** lies in the middle of the energy gap, as the material is pure and undoped.
  - **Diagram:** A line showing the conduction band and valence band with the Fermi level exactly in the middle.

**ii) N-Type Semiconductor:**
- **Description:** In an n-type semiconductor, extra electrons (donor electrons) are added through doping with an element that has more valence electrons than the semiconductor (e.g., Phosphorus in Silicon).
- **Energy Band Diagram:**
  - The **conduction band (CB)** is close to the **Fermi level (Ef)**, reflecting the presence of additional free electrons.
  - The **valence band (VB)** remains unaffected.
  - The Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band.
  - **Diagram:** The conduction band is just below the Fermi level, which is shifted above the intrinsic level.

**iii) P-Type Semiconductor:**
- **Description:** In a p-type semiconductor, acceptor atoms are added through doping (e.g., Boron in Silicon), which creates holes in the valence band.
- **Energy Band Diagram:**
  - The **Fermi level (Ef)** lies closer to the **valence band (VB)** due to the increased number of holes.
  - The **conduction band (CB)** remains unaffected.
  - The Fermi level shifts closer to the valence band.
  - **Diagram:** The Fermi level is closer to the valence band, indicating a higher hole concentration.

### 3. **Law of Mass Action (3 Marks)**

- **Statement:** The law of mass action in semiconductors states that the product of the electron concentration (n) and hole concentration (p) is constant at a given temperature, and is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration (ni):
  \[
  n \cdot p = n_i^2
  \]
  where:
  - **n** = Electron concentration in the conduction band
  - **p** = Hole concentration in the valence band
  - **n_i** = Intrinsic carrier concentration (which depends on the temperature)
  
- **Explanation:**
  - This relationship holds for intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors and is valid under thermal equilibrium.
  - It shows that an increase in electron concentration (n) will lead to a proportional decrease in hole concentration (p) for the material to maintain the constant \(n_i^2\).

### 4. **Quasi-Fermi Level (3 Marks)**

- **Definition:** The **quasi-Fermi level** is a concept used to describe the energy levels of electrons and holes in a semiconductor under non-equilibrium conditions, such as when it is subjected to an external current or under illumination.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - When a semiconductor is in equilibrium, there is only one Fermi level that represents both electrons and holes.
  - Under non-equilibrium conditions (e.g., under biasing or illumination), the electron and hole populations may shift, leading to different energy distributions for electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band.
  - The **quasi-Fermi level** separates these distributions and reflects the separate energy levels for electrons and holes under non-equilibrium conditions.
  - There can be two quasi-Fermi levels: one for electrons (denoted as \(E_{F,n}\)) and one for holes (\(E_{F,p}\)).

### 5. **Fermi-Dirac Distribution Function (3 Marks)**

- **Definition:** The **Fermi-Dirac distribution function** describes the probability that a state at a given energy level is occupied by an electron in a semiconductor.
  
- **Mathematical Expression:**
  \[
  f(E) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(E - E_F)/kT}}
  \]
  where:
  - **f(E)** = Probability of occupancy of a state with energy E.
  - **E_F** = Fermi energy.
  - **k** = Boltzmann constant.
  - **T** = Temperature in Kelvin.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - At **absolute zero** (T = 0), all states below the Fermi energy are filled, and all states above are empty.
  - At higher temperatures, the probability of occupation gradually becomes less than 1 for states near and above the Fermi level, following the Fermi-Dirac distribution.

### 6. **Indirect Recombination Mechanism for Semiconductors (3 Marks)**

- **Indirect Recombination:** In indirect bandgap semiconductors (such as Silicon), electron recombination is not straightforward.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - An electron in the conduction band must first lose some energy through a phonon interaction before recombining with a hole in the valence band.
  - This is a slower process compared to **direct recombination**, where the electron can recombine with the hole without the need for phonon interaction.
  - The **phonon** (a quanta of lattice vibration) is necessary to conserve momentum during the electron-hole recombination in indirect bandgap semiconductors.

### 7. **Quasi-Fermi Level Revisited (3 Marks)**

- **Quasi-Fermi Levels** are introduced under conditions of **non-equilibrium** where carriers are injected into the material (e.g., through biasing or optical excitation).
  
- **Revisiting the Concept:** 
  - In equilibrium, there is a single Fermi level. But under non-equilibrium conditions (e.g., in a biased pn-junction or a solar cell), electrons and holes are injected, leading to separate energy distributions.
  - **Electron quasi-Fermi level** (for the conduction band) and **hole quasi-Fermi level** (for the valence band) can be defined to represent the non-equilibrium populations of electrons and holes.
  - These levels allow for a more accurate description of carrier dynamics in devices like LEDs, solar cells, and transistors under operating conditions.
