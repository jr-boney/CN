### **1. Explain Message Encapsulation in Layered Architecture (3 marks)** (Continued)

Message encapsulation refers to the process of wrapping data with additional information as it moves through different layers in a network protocol stack. Each layer of the stack adds its specific control information (headers and trailers) before passing it down to the next layer:

- **Application Layer**: The user’s data is passed from the application layer to the transport layer.
- **Transport Layer**: Adds a header to the data that includes information about end-to-end communication, like source and destination ports.
- **Network Layer**: Adds another header containing routing information (such as source and destination IP addresses) to forward the data across networks.
- **Data Link Layer**: Adds a header and trailer to ensure proper data framing, error checking (like CRC), and addresses for local delivery (such as MAC addresses).
- **Physical Layer**: Converts the frame into bits and transmits it over the communication medium (e.g., copper wires, fiber optics, etc.).

As the message passes down the layers, each layer adds its control information. When it reaches the destination, the data is passed up the layers, where headers are stripped off sequentially.

### **2. Compare and Contrast SMTP and POP3 Protocols (3 marks)** (Continued)

| **Feature**            | **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**                       | **POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)**                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | SMTP is used for **sending** emails to a mail server or between servers. | POP3 is used for **retrieving** emails from the mail server to the client. |
| **Connection**         | Maintains an open connection throughout the session until the message is sent. | Creates a connection to download emails and closes after the session ends. |
| **Statefulness**       | SMTP is **stateless**; the connection is terminated after the mail is delivered. | POP3 is **stateful**; keeps track of emails until they are downloaded by the client. |
| **Email Deletion**     | The server stores the email; once sent, emails are not deleted. | Emails are deleted from the server once downloaded (though this behavior can be configured). |
| **Use**                | Primarily used to send outgoing emails.                        | Primarily used to fetch and read incoming emails.             |

### **3. Differentiate UDP and TCP (3 marks)** (Continued)

| **Feature**            | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**                         | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reliability**        | Does not guarantee delivery (unreliable).               | Guarantees delivery through acknowledgments and retransmissions. |
| **Flow Control**       | No flow control; does not manage how much data is sent.  | Implements flow control mechanisms to avoid congestion and buffer overflow. |
| **Congestion Control** | No congestion control; may lead to network congestion.   | Provides congestion control (e.g., slow-start, congestion avoidance). |
| **Ordering**           | Does not ensure in-order delivery.                      | Ensures data arrives in the correct order.                 |
| **Use Cases**          | Suitable for real-time applications (e.g., VoIP, video streaming). | Used for applications that require reliable communication (e.g., web browsing, file transfer). |

### **4. Explain Stop-and-Wait Protocol with the Help of a Timing Diagram (3 marks)** (Continued)

**Stop-and-Wait Protocol**:
- In this protocol, the sender sends one data frame and then waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next frame.

**Timing Diagram**:

```
Sender                    Receiver
  |                         |
  |--- Frame 1 ------------->| (Send Frame 1)
  |                         |
  |<--- ACK 1 --------------| (Receiver sends ACK 1)
  |                         |
  |--- Frame 2 ------------->| (Send Frame 2 after ACK 1)
  |                         |
  .                         .
  .
```

- The sender cannot send more than one frame at a time. It waits for the acknowledgment of the previous frame before sending the next one.
- If no ACK is received within a timeout period, the sender retransmits the frame.

This protocol is simple but inefficient in terms of throughput, especially in high-latency networks, as it requires a round-trip wait for each frame before sending the next.

### **5. Services Offered by the Network Layer (3 marks)** (Continued)

The **Network Layer** in the OSI model provides essential services that enable data to travel across multiple networks:

1. **Routing**: Determines the best path for data packets from source to destination.
2. **Logical Addressing**: Provides devices with unique identifiers (IP addresses), which are necessary for routing and forwarding data across different networks.
3. **Packet Forwarding**: Forwards data packets to their destination based on the routing table and IP address.
4. **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks large packets into smaller fragments to accommodate various network link limitations, and reassembles them at the destination.
5. **Error Handling**: Protocols like ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) help diagnose issues, such as unreachable destinations, by sending error messages.

The network layer operates independently of the physical and data link layers and facilitates end-to-end communication between devices in different networks.

### **6. Compare and Contrast Link-State and Distance-Vector Routing Algorithms (3 marks)** (Continued)

| **Feature**            | **Link-State Routing Algorithm**                              | **Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm**                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Routing Information**| Every router has a complete map of the network's topology.    | Routers only know the distance to directly connected neighbors. |
| **Update Method**      | Routers exchange detailed network topology information, sending updates only when the network changes. | Routers send periodic updates containing their routing table to neighbors. |
| **Convergence Time**   | Faster convergence since routers have a complete network view. | Slower convergence as information is passed along from router to router. |
| **Scalability**        | More scalable for larger networks because of quicker and more efficient updates. | Less scalable as the routing table size grows with network size. |
| **Example**            | OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System). | RIP (Routing Information Protocol).                           |

### **7. Describe Ethernet Frame Structure (3 marks)** (Continued)

The **Ethernet Frame** structure includes the following components:

1. **Preamble (7 bytes)**: A sequence of bits that helps synchronize the transmission.
2. **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) (1 byte)**: Indicates the start of the frame.
3. **Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Specifies the destination device's MAC address.
4. **Source MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Specifies the sender's MAC address.
5. **EtherType (2 bytes)**: Identifies the protocol being used (e.g., IPv4, ARP).
6. **Data (46-1500 bytes)**: The actual data or payload being transmitted. If it's smaller than 46 bytes, padding is added to meet the minimum size requirement.
7. **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) (4 bytes)**: Used for error detection, ensuring data integrity.

The **Ethernet frame** is one of the most commonly used data link layer frame formats in networking.

### **8. Explain Any One of the Channel Partitioning Protocols (3 marks)** (Continued)

**Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)** is another channel partitioning protocol. In TDMA:

- The available bandwidth is divided into **time slots**, and each user is allocated a specific time slot to transmit data.
- **Working**: In a system where multiple users are sharing the same channel, each user is assigned a specific time interval (slot) during which they can transmit. The user transmits data only during their allocated time, ensuring no interference.
- **Example**: TDMA is used in cellular networks such as GSM.

TDMA ensures that multiple users can share the same frequency band without interfering with each other by dividing time into distinct intervals.

### **9. Describe Poisson Process (3 marks)** (Continued)

A **Poisson process** is used to model random events that occur independently and at a constant average rate. It is often used to represent the arrival of entities (such as customers or packets) in systems like queues or communication networks. Key characteristics:

- **Constant Rate**: Events occur at a constant average rate \( \lambda \) (events per time unit).
- **Independence**: The occurrence of an event does not affect the probability of the next event.
- **Memorylessness**: The time until the next event occurs does not depend on when the last event happened.
  
The number of events in a Poisson process over a time interval follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of \( \lambda t \), where \( t \) is the time period.

### **10. Customers Arriving at a Bank (3 marks)** (Continued)

Using **Little's Theorem**, we can calculate the average number of customers in the bank:

- **Arrival rate**: \( \lambda = 5 \) customers per minute.
- **Average waiting time** with an officer: \( W = 5 \) minutes.
- **The total probability of service** is \( P(\text{spending time with officer}) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\text{handover application

}) = 0.5 \).

The average number of customers in the bank is given by Little's Theorem:

\[
L = \lambda \times W
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = 5 \times 5 = 25
\]

Therefore, the average number of customers in the bank is **25**.
